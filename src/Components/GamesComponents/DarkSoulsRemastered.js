            In these lines, I won't be very coherent because it's difficult to review a work of art. Dark Souls Remastered is one of the best games ever made, and I'll try to argue this statement. 
            After a few hours in the game, the first thing you notice is how the world is constructed. The areas are interconnected, and this isn't just a shortcut after exploring a zone. 
            This interconnectedness allows multiple approaches to the game, not just by choosing different builds, but by taking a different route through the game, exploring areas in a different order, defeating bosses in a different sequence. 
            This enhances the player's experience when attempting different builds, as you can start in zones where you have an advantage.

            For example, at the beginning of a new character, we can choose the Master Key, which allows early access to Blighttown. 
            This is particularly useful if you're using a pyromancer build, as you can go there early, collect some soul items for a few level-ups, defeat Maneater Mildred to summon her for the Quelaag boss fight. 
            After defeating the boss, you obtain Great Chaos Fireball upon entering the Chaos Servant covenant. Of course, this isn't recommended for beginners. 
            Another quick run I like to do with a new character is the run to Pinwheel, which guarantees 15,000 souls, providing a consistent start.

Speaking of the builds that can be made, they are relatively simple compared to other games in the series. For a first run, it's quite challenging to create a hybrid build; 
at most, you can create a dexterity build that affects spell casting speed, so you can have a Uchigatana with Flame of Pyromancy, for example. 
Bosses often don't represent a significant challenge. Mechanically, they're not anything special; they can be difficult due to the journey to reach them and/or due to the small size of the arena (Capra demon).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now, let's talk about the game's biggest drawback, which could also be its greatest strength. The game looks fantastic for a title released in 2011; the issue is that the game looks exactly the same in the 2018 remastered version, which is a significant disappointment.
Graphically speaking, the game could have been greatly improved. Don't get me wrong, it still offers that dark atmosphere, but the vistas from high points on the map could have been on par with Dark Souls 3.
