            To be honest, I dislike horror games and movies, mostly because I don't enjoy jump scares; they feel like cheap tactics. However, Phasmophobia doesn't fall into that category. It's scary, but the events that occur are mostly events you're aware of beforehand. The gameplay is intriguing, requiring you to gather clues to confirm the type of ghost present in the location you're exploring.

I'll reiterate that this isn't the type of game I typically enjoy. Nonetheless, it offers an enjoyable cooperative experience.

With the new update, they've introduced tiered paranormal detection items, a prestige system, and a new progression system involving unlocking items as you go along.

I'm pleased to see such a small team putting so much effort into an early access game, delivering substantial updates and hotfixes. I hope they continue in this manner even after the game's official launch.
